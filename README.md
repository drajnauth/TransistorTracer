# TransistorTracer
Hardware and software for transistor tracer project.

KiCad PCB files for various versions of the transistor tracer as well as PlatformIO files for the firmware for the Arduino Nano.
The documentation folder contains a pdf version of a PowerPoint presentation regarding the tracer as well as build and operation instructions

A presentation introducing the tracer can be found at https://youtu.be/t6_chWRdSyg.  
This video is a bit dated and some of the information regardig the build, calibration and usage may have changed.

Currently only Hardware version 1 is documented and is working. Other versions are experimental and has not been verified.  
The software for experimental board versions may not work.
